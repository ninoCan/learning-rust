# Learning Rust

In this repo, you will find a few snippets and material I used to toying around while moving my first steps with rust.

## Linux Foundation 

Under the [linux-foundation](./linux-foundation) you can find stored my notes and adaptation of the scripts encountered
while taking the ["Getting Started with Rust"](https://trainingportal.linuxfoundation.org/courses/getting-started-with-rust-lfel1002) course.
